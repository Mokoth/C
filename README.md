# Fundamental concepts - C

* **Data Types** - 
`int`, `double` and `char`.
* **Variables** - 
A variable is used to store data so that we can use them later in the program.
* **Output -** 
The `printf()` function is used to display output on the screen. We use format specifiers with `printf()` to print variables: 
(`%d` for `int`, `%lf` for `double`, and `%c` for `char`).
* **Comments -** 
Comments are used to add hints and explanations in our program. In C, a comment starts with `//`.
* **Operators -** 
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations such as addition `+`, subtraction `-`, division (quotient `/`, remainder `%`), etc.
* **Type Conversion -** 
It's possible to convert the data of one type to another. Conversion can happen both automatically (implicit) and manually (explicit).
* **Take Input -** 
The `scanf()` function is used to take input from the user. The function takes input and stores it in the variable.
