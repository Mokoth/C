# Compiling C Code with `gcc`
---

gcc is an application used to compile C programs into an executable that
can run on the target computer.
gcc stands for GNU Compiler Collection.

gcc compiles C code using the code file as an unflagged command-line argument. 
The output executable file will be called a.out. 
The -o flag followed by some text can be used to designate the name of the output executable file.
